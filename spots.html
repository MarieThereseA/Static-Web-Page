        <h1>NYC Spots</h1>

        <p>Do you want the good news or bad news first?</p>

        <p>Well I'll tell you the bad news</p>

        <p>There are a few not so great things about NYC like:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The dirty streets and public transportation</li>
            <li>The city's over population and tendency to feel rushed</li>
            <li>The city zoned inflation (why is a sandwich that's $5 near my house $7 downtown?)</li>
            <li>Everything cost's something</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That aside, there are many great things about the city and amazing advantages to living in such a busy place</p>

        <p>These include NYC spots that I've come to enjoy over my highschool career</p>

                    There's a wide selection of vendors and food from all over.
                    However be prepared to spend $15-$20 as the prices are on the higher end.

                    I particulary bring a large blanket and find a spot on the grass to sit/lay and relax with frieds.
                    Often times there will be music playing and a few vendors so it's esy to get comfortable and spend 1-2 hours there.

                    Often times, influencers native to NYC will host meet & greet's here or games at the basketball courts.
                    I don't come here as often as the other places but it's still a cool place to be if you enjoy lively enviornmrnts.

                    All you have to do is book a table online and once you arrive you and your party can enter with your reservation and get to playing.
                    You can also have your matches recorded and sent over to you.
                    It's a quick, fun activity and one of those things that you could only find in a city as big as NYC.

                    target="_blank">Museum of Ice Cream</a> for the first time and it was a surprisingly fun and interactive experince. 
                    I myself enjoy museums however, I understand the boredom some people experience while in regular museums.
                    The Museum of Ice Cream however, wasn't just art with captions, but a curated experience with unlimited ice cream samples along the way.
                    Tickets are on the pricier side ranging from $40-$55 but there are discounts for certain time slots so be on the lookout.

                    Since sophmore year, I've gone ice skating every winter with my friends. 
                    Beleive it or not, I still don't know how to skate.
                    It may seem intimidating at first but halfway into your skating session you'll feel comfortable pushing off the edges of the rink and attempting to skate freely.
